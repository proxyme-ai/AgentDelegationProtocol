| **Compromised Agent** | Varies (controlled by attacker) | Legitimate credentials, insider access | Internal |
| **Network Attacker** | Surveillance, data interception | Traffic analysis, MITM | Network |
| **Insider Threat** | Sabotage, data theft | System access, credential access | Internal |
| **State Actor** | Espionage, disruption | Advanced persistent threats | External/Internal |

## Core Threat Capabilities (C1-C8)

### C1: Malicious Agent Registration
**Description**: Adversaries create and register malicious agents under their own identity.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant MA as Malicious Actor
    participant AS as Auth Server
    participant RS as Resource Server
    
    MA->>AS: POST /register (malicious agent)
    AS->>MA: Registration successful
    MA->>AS: Request delegation token
    AS->>MA: Issue token (legitimate process)
    MA->>RS: Access resources with malicious intent
    
    Note over MA,RS: Agent appears legitimate but acts maliciously
```

**Risk Level**: HIGH
**Likelihood**: HIGH
**Impact**: Data theft, system compromise

### C2: Legitimate Agent Compromise
**Description**: A legitimate agent is compromised and misused by an adversary.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant ATT as Attacker
    participant LA as Legitimate Agent
    participant AS as Auth Server
    participant RS as Resource Server
    
    ATT->>LA: Compromise agent (malware, etc.)
    LA->>AS: Request tokens (normal flow)
    AS->>LA: Issue tokens
    ATT->>RS: Misuse agent's legitimate tokens
    
    Note over ATT,RS: Legitimate credentials used maliciously
```

**Risk Level**: CRITICAL
**Likelihood**: MEDIUM
**Impact**: Privilege escalation, data breach

### C3: Agent Self-Replication
**Description**: Agents replicate themselves without registering with the Provider.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A1[Original Agent] -->|Clones| A2[Clone Agent 1]
    A1 -->|Clones| A3[Clone Agent 2]
    A2 -->|Shares Tokens| A3
    A3 -->|Unauthorized Access| RS[Resource Server]
    
    style A2 fill:#ff9999
    style A3 fill:#ff9999
```

**Risk Level**: HIGH
**Likelihood**: MEDIUM
**Impact**: Token abuse, resource exhaustion

### C4: Token Sharing Between Agents
**Description**: One adversarial agent shares keys/tokens with another to impersonate or contact benign agents.

**Risk Level**: HIGH
**Likelihood**: MEDIUM
**Impact**: Identity confusion, unauthorized access

### C5: Sybil Attack
**Description**: Adversary conducts a Sybil attack by registering multiple agent identities.

```mermaid
graph TB
    ATT[Attacker] -->|Registers| A1[Agent ID 1]
    ATT -->|Registers| A2[Agent ID 2]
    ATT -->|Registers| A3[Agent ID 3]
    ATT -->|Registers| AN[Agent ID N]
    
    A1 -->|Coordinated Attack| RS[Resource Server]
    A2 -->|Coordinated Attack| RS
    A3 -->|Coordinated Attack| RS
    AN -->|Coordinated Attack| RS
    
    style ATT fill:#ff6666
```

**Risk Level**: MEDIUM
**Likelihood**: HIGH
**Impact**: Resource exhaustion, rate limit bypass

## Attack Models (A1-A8)

### A1: TLS Authentication Bypass
**Attack Vector**: Malicious agent tries to contact a legitimate one without valid TLS certs
**Expected Outcome**: TLS handshake fails
**Mitigation Status**: ✅ MITIGATED (TLS enforcement)

### A2: Tokenless Access
**Attack Vector**: Agent initiates communication without presenting a valid OTK or access token
**Expected Outcome**: Access denied
**Mitigation Status**: ✅ MITIGATED (Token validation)

### A3: Expired Token Reuse
**Attack Vector**: Malicious agent uses expired or overused access tokens
**Expected Outcome**: Detected and connection closed
**Mitigation Status**: ✅ MITIGATED (Token expiry validation)

### A4: Impersonation with Public Metadata
**Attack Vector**: Replays provider-issued signature of another agent to impersonate
**Expected Outcome**: Verification fails
**Mitigation Status**: ✅ MITIGATED (JWT signature validation)

### A5: Token Misuse (Wrong Agent)
**Attack Vector**: Reuses a valid token issued to a different agent
**Expected Outcome**: Identity mismatch leads to rejection
**Mitigation Status**: ✅ MITIGATED (Actor claim validation)

### A6: Contact Policy Violation
**Attack Vector**: Tries to communicate despite not being in the receiving agent's allowlist
**Expected Outcome**: Blocked by Provider
**Mitigation Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL (Basic scope validation)

### A7: Self-Replication Registration
**Attack Vector**: Attempts to auto-register clones
**Expected Outcome**: Blocked by human-in-the-loop verification
**Mitigation Status**: ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED

### A8: Limited Abuse with Valid Token
**Attack Vector**: Adversary uses a valid token, but impact is limited by expiry and quota
**Expected Outcome**: Limited damage due to controls
**Mitigation Status**: ✅ MITIGATED (Token expiry, scope limits)

## Advanced Attack Scenarios

### AS1: JWT Secret Compromise
**Description**: Attacker gains access to JWT signing secret
**Impact**: Complete protocol compromise
**Likelihood**: LOW
**Severity**: CRITICAL

### AS2: Time-based Attacks
**Description**: Exploiting clock skew or time validation weaknesses
**Impact**: Token replay, extended validity
**Likelihood**: MEDIUM
**Severity**: MEDIUM

### AS3: Scope Escalation
**Description**: Manipulating scope claims to gain elevated privileges
**Impact**: Unauthorized resource access
**Likelihood**: MEDIUM
**Severity**: HIGH

### AS4: PKCE Bypass
**Description**: Circumventing PKCE protection mechanisms
**Impact**: Authorization code interception
**Likelihood**: LOW
**Severity**: HIGH

### AS5: Resource Server Impersonation
**Description**: Malicious server impersonating legitimate resource server
**Impact**: Data theft, credential harvesting
**Likelihood**: MEDIUM
**Severity**: HIGH

## Conclusion

The Agent Delegation Protocol implements solid foundational security controls but requires additional protections against advanced threats. The primary risks stem from malicious agent registration and potential agent compromise scenarios. Implementation of the recommended security controls will significantly improve the protocol's security posture.
