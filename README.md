# Agent Delegation Protocol

This repository implements a complete prototype of the **Agent Delegation Protocol** inspired by the paper _"Authenticated Delegation and Authorized AI Agents"_.

It demonstrates how to securely delegate authority from a human user to an AI agent using standard OAuth2-like patterns, JWT tokens, and Python-based microservices.

## üß© Components

- **Authorization Server (`auth_server.py`)**
  - Issues signed delegation tokens to AI agents on behalf of users.
  - Exposes token exchange and revocation endpoints.

- **Resource Server (`resource_server.py`)**
  - Validates access tokens and enforces scope- and identity-based access.

- **AI Agent (`ai_agent.py`)**
  - Simulates a delegated agent requesting access and consuming a protected resource.

## üîß Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+

Install required packages:
```bash
pip install Flask PyJWT requests
```

## üöÄ Running the System

Start each service in its own terminal:

### 1. Authorization Server
```bash
python auth_server.py
```

### 2. Resource Server
```bash
python resource_server.py
```

### 3. AI Agent (Client)
```bash
python ai_agent.py
```

## ‚úÖ Expected Flow

- The AI agent requests a **delegation token** for a user (`alice`).
- It exchanges the delegation token for a signed **access token**.
- It then uses the access token to call a protected endpoint on the Resource Server.

## üîí Security Features

- Delegation token includes `user`, `agent`, `scope`, and `exp` (expiry).
- Access token includes both `sub` (user) and `actor` (agent).
- Token introspection and revocation endpoints included.

## üîÅ Revocation
To revoke an access token:
```bash
curl -X POST -d "token=<access_token>" http://localhost:5000/revoke
```
Subsequent attempts to use the token will be rejected.

## üìÇ File Structure

## Overview

The Agent Delegation Protocol enables secure delegation of limited authority from a human user to an autonomous AI agent. It is built on existing standards like OAuth 2.1 and OpenID Connect, enabling straightforward implementation using JWTs, token exchange, and scope enforcement.

## Roles and Responsibilities

| Role             | Responsibility                                                                 |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| User             | Human delegator who authorizes an AI agent to perform actions on their behalf |
| AI Agent         | Software agent acting on behalf of the user with restricted authority         |
| Authorization Server (AS) | Issues tokens, manages delegation, revocation, and token validation       |
| Resource Server (RS) | Hosts protected APIs and enforces access control based on verified tokens     |

## Protocol Flows

### 1. High-Level Architecture
```mermaid
graph LR
    U[User]
    A[AI Agent]
    AS[Authorization Server]
    RS[Resource Server]
    U -- "delegates authority" --> A
    U -- "authenticates at" --> AS
    A -- "requests tokens" --> AS
    A -- "accesses API with token" --> RS
    RS -. "validates token via" .-> AS
```

### 2. Delegation Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Agent as "AI Agent"
    participant AS as "Authorization Server (AS)"
    User ->> Agent: Request task (requires API access)
    Agent ->> AS: Initiate delegation (ask for permission scope)
    AS ->> User: Prompt login & consent (show Agent identity + scope)
    User ->> AS: Authenticate (login to AS)
    User ->> AS: Consent to grant Agent access
    AS ->> Agent: Issue Delegation Token
```

### 3. Token Exchange Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Agent as "AI Agent"
    participant AS as "Authorization Server"
    Agent ->> AS: Send Delegation Token for Token Exchange
    AS ->> AS: Validate delegation scope and signatures
    AS ->> Agent: Issue Access Token for Resource Server
```

### 4. Resource Access Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Agent as "AI Agent"
    participant RS as "Resource Server"
    Agent ->> RS: Call API with Access Token
    RS ->> RS: Verify token claims (sub, actor, scope, expiry)
    RS ->> Agent: Return API response
```

### 5. Revocation Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Admin as "User/Admin"
    participant AS as "Authorization Server"
    participant RS as "Resource Server"
    Admin ->> AS: Send revoke request
    AS ->> RS: Token marked invalid
    Agent ->> RS: Access with revoked token
    RS ->> Agent: Access denied
```

## Token Types and Claims

### 1. **Delegation Token (JWT)**
| Claim         | Description                                |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `iss`         | Authorization server issuer                |
| `sub`         | Agent ID                                   |
| `delegator`   | User ID (who granted permission)           |
| `scope`       | Array of approved permissions              |
| `exp`, `iat`  | Expiry and issued-at timestamps            |

### 2. **Access Token (JWT)**
| Claim         | Description                                |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `sub`         | User ID                                    |
| `actor`       | Agent ID                                   |
| `scope`       | Delegated permissions                      |
| `aud`         | Audience (Resource Server)                 |
| `exp`, `iat`  | Expiry and issued-at timestamps            |

## Scope and Permission Design

- Define fine-grained scopes: e.g., `calendar:read`, `email:send`
- Map AI agent tasks to minimum necessary scopes
- Include constraints in token claims (e.g. time limits, resource IDs)

---

## Security Considerations

- All tokens are signed JWTs (e.g. RS256)
- Short token lifetimes, with optional refresh flow
- Explicit binding between `user`, `agent`, and `scope`
- Revocation endpoint invalidates issued tokens
- Optionally support DPoP or mTLS for proof of possession

---

## Python Implementation Guide

- Use `Flask` to implement Authorization and Resource servers
- Use `PyJWT` for encoding/decoding tokens
- Use `requests` for agent and RS communication

```bash
pip install Flask PyJWT requests
```

See full working implementation in the following files:
- `auth_server.py`
- `resource_server.py`
- `ai_agent.py`

Each file corresponds directly to a role in the protocol and can be launched independently.

---

_This protocol supports the secure and auditable execution of AI agents across distributed systems while maintaining clear user intent and limited delegation._
