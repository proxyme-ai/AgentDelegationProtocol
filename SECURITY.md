# Security Considerations

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Agent Delegation Protocol and provides guidance for secure deployment.

## Security Features

### 1. Token Security
- **JWT Signing**: All tokens are signed using HS256 (HMAC with SHA-256)
- **Short Lifetimes**: Access tokens expire in 5 minutes, delegation tokens in 10 minutes
- **Token Revocation**: Immediate revocation capability for compromised tokens
- **PKCE Support**: Proof Key for Code Exchange prevents authorization code interception

### 2. Authentication & Authorization
- **User Authentication**: Required before delegation
- **Agent Registration**: Only registered agents can request delegation
- **Scope Limitation**: Fine-grained permission control
- **Actor Claims**: Clear identification of both user and agent in tokens

### 3. Transport Security
- **HTTPS Required**: All production deployments must use HTTPS
- **Secure Headers**: Implement security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
- **CORS Configuration**: Properly configured cross-origin resource sharing

## Security Best Practices

### Deployment
1. **Use Strong JWT Secrets**: Generate cryptographically secure secrets
2. **Enable HTTPS**: Never deploy without TLS encryption
3. **Secure Storage**: Protect agent and user data files
4. **Regular Key Rotation**: Rotate JWT signing keys periodically

### Development
1. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
2. **Error Handling**: Don't leak sensitive information in error messages
3. **Logging**: Log security events without exposing secrets
4. **Testing**: Include security tests in your test suite

### Production Checklist
- [ ] HTTPS enabled with valid certificates
- [ ] Strong JWT secret (32+ characters, random)
- [ ] Secure file permissions for data files
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting set up
- [ ] Regular security updates applied

## Threat Model

### Mitigated Threats
- **Token Interception**: PKCE and short lifetimes
- **Replay Attacks**: Token expiration and revocation
- **Unauthorized Access**: Agent registration and user authentication
- **Privilege Escalation**: Scope-based access control

### Remaining Risks
- **Compromised JWT Secret**: Would allow token forgery
- **Insider Threats**: Authorized users acting maliciously
- **Side-Channel Attacks**: Timing attacks on token validation

## Incident Response
1. **Token Compromise**: Immediately revoke affected tokens
2. **Secret Compromise**: Rotate JWT secret and invalidate all tokens
3. **Agent Compromise**: Deregister agent and revoke all its tokens
4. **User Compromise**: Reset user credentials and revoke tokens
